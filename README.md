Hello! We're currently working on several projects, including a new iOS game and our updated website, but they're not quite ready to share.

We've really enjoyed developing and testing our game so far, and we hope you'll like it too. We still have a few final tasks to complete, but we'll be sure to update this site once everything is finished.

When the game launches, you'll find all the details here, along with the App Store link and a FAQ to help you get started.
